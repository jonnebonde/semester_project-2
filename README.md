 Auction house is an website where users can create listings to be bid on and bid on listings other users have made.

## Description

Auction house serves as a vibrant online marketplace, offering users the ability to both list their items for auction and participate in bidding on items listed by others. As a welcoming gesture, we provide new users with an initial balance of 1000 credits, which they can accumulate by selling items or spend while making purchases on our platform. It's important to note that while browsing through listings is open to all, the privilege of placing bids on items is exclusively reserved for registered users.
